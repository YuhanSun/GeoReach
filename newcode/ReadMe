This new code folder is little bit different from original codes because in one time only one ratio of data is loaded.

Hence offset is always number of vertices. 

In fact, speed of accessing attributes are influenced by size of each node. So I use the codes to eliminate influence of node size. If I load data of all rations(from 20% to 80%), accessing speed will be slower. In fact, random, clustered, zipf data all attached to one node will also cause the same problem.
